# This file documents all configuration options for RAIS.  You may use this by
# copying it to /etc/rais.toml (or having rais.toml in the working directory
# when you run rais-server) and adjusting the values per your needs.  You can
# also use environment variables and, in many cases, command-line flags.  These
# are all documented here as "Env: RAIS_..." and "CLI: --...".
#
# In a traditional server environment, using this file is often a good
# approach.  In a more cloud-centric environment, environment values may be
# easier (and are considered best-practice).  For development or testing, it
# may be easiest to set up a configuration file locally and/or override with
# command-line flags.
#
# Any configuration setting specified in a file is ignored if the same setting
# is set in the environment.  The environment is overridden by settings on the
# command-line.

# Address: Optional, defaults to ":12415".  This is where RAIS listens for
# traffic.  The default value causes RAIS to accept anything that talks to port
# 12415 on the server.
#
# Env: RAIS_ADDRESS
# CLI: --address
Address = ":12415"

# AdminAddress: Optional, defaults to ":12416".  This is another web listener,
# but exposes information which you may not want exposed publicly.  If you set
# this to the same value as Address (above), admin endpoints will be exposed on
# the same port as the public endpoints.
#
# Env: RAIS_ADMINADDRESS
# CLI: --admin-address
AdminAddress = ":12416"

# LogLevel: Optional, defaults to "DEBUG".  Log messages below this severity
# are ignored.
#
# Env: RAIS_LOGLEVEL
# CLI: --log-level
LogLevel = "INFO"

# TilePath: Required.  Set this to the path where images can be found.  Note
# that docker uses an environment setting to force this to "/var/local/images",
# and environment settings override config file settings.
#
# Env: RAIS_TILEPATH
# CLI: --tile-path
TilePath = "/var/local/images"

# IIIFWebPath: Optional, defaults to "/iiif".  This is the endpoint on which
# RAIS will listen for IIIF requests.
#
# Env: RAIS_IIIFWEBPATH
# CLI: --iiif-web-path
IIIFWebPath = "/iiif"

# IIIFBaseURL: Optional: allows RAIS to report URLs for its assets when a IIIF
# info request occurs.  If used, make sure this is set to the *public* URL, and
# do not add a path.  The base web path should be set above.
#
# Typically, proxy servers (like Apache or nginx) can be configured to give
# RAIS enough information to deduce its base URL, making this unnecessary.
# However, a handful of situations warrant manually specifying the base URL:
#
# - You expose RAIS directly to the Internet.  In this scenario, people can
#   fake the headers which Apache and nginx normally use when forwarding
#   requests, causing RAIS to misrepresent its hostname.  There's no risk in
#   fake hostnames from a security perspective, but RAIS wouldn't function.
# - Whatever is proxying to RAIS needs to respond on a nonstandard port (80 for
#   http and 443 for https are the standard ports)
# - RAIS is behind multiple levels of proxies, and configuring them all to
#   forward the proper data is more of a pain than simply configuring RAIS.
# - You need RAIS to report a specific base URL, such as when it's reachable
#   from multiple hostnames, but you want a canonical response
#
# Env: RAIS_IIIFBASEURL
# CLI: --iiig-base-url
#IIIFBaseURL = "http://rais.my.edu:12415"

# InfoCacheLen: Optional, defaults to 10000.  Set this to 0 to avoid caching
# IIIF Info requests, or set it higher to cache more requests.  The overhead
# for caching is very small; probably under 500 bytes of RAM per cached item.
# But the CPU / IO overhead for generating info requests dynamically is pretty
# small as well.
#
# Env: RAIS_INFOCACHELEN
# CLI: --iiif-info-cache-size
InfoCacheLen = 10000

# CapabilitiesFile: Optional, allows removal of undesired capabilities, such as
# image mirroring, TIFF output, etc.  See cap-max.toml and cap-level0.toml.
CapabilitiesFile = ""

# TileCacheLen: Optional, defaults to 0.  Set this to the *number* of tiles
# you'd like to cache.  Currently the cache is set to only store specific types
# of requests in order to only cache JPG tiles.  The amount of RAM which may be
# used will vary greatly depending on what ends up being cached.  For
# newspapers, it's not unreasonable for a tile to be as large as 100k, and for
# a single page to have up to 200 unique 1024x1024 tiles.  Therefore a
# 10,000-item cache could use as much as a gig of RAM, and still only hold 50
# pages.  In practice, this is likely to only be useful for caching small
# exhibits or else sites that have one or a few "featured" images which receive
# heavy traffic.
#
# Env: RAIS_TILECACHELEN
TileCacheLen = 0

# Plugins: Optional, defaults to "-".
#
# Comma-separated list of which plugins should be loaded.  A value of "" or "-"
# will disable plugins entirely.
#
# Items in the list which don't specify an absolute path must be in a "plugins"
# subdirectory the lives alongside the rais-server binary.
#
# This list can include wildcards, such as "s3*.so,foo.so", as well as absolute
# paths, such as "/usr/local/rais/plugins/*.so".  It can also explicitly
# specify individual plugins to avoid accidentally loading plugins you don't
# want in production, even if they are compiled into the plugins/ subdirectory.
#
# A value of "*.so" replicates the 3.0.x behavior of loading everything in
# plugins/
#
# Env: RAIS_PLUGINS
# CLI: --plugins
Plugins = ""

# JPGQuality: Optional, defaults to 75.  This must be between 1 and 100, where
# 1 is very low quality but very small JPGs, and 100 is very high quality, but
# very large files.  Set this if you want to fine-tune the compression of
# requested JPG files.  75 is typically a good mix of efficiency and quality.
#
# Env: RAIS_JPGQUALITY
# CLI: --jpg-quality
#JPGQuality = 95

####
# If you wanted to globally limit request size, use the below values.  By
# default, the server doesn't try to limit request size simply because it's
# impossible for us to assume what makes sense for a given image server.
#
# If an image is smaller than these values, there is no effect on the incoming
# requests.  If an image is larger, the maximum requests will be constrained
# and the IIIF info.json profile will report these maximums so that clients
# will be aware of the limits.
####

# ImageMaxArea is the maximum number of pixels delivered: 104857600 allows RAIS to
# deliver a 100-megapixel image raw.
#
# Env: RAIS_IMAGEMAXAREA
# CLI: --image-max-area
ImageMaxArea = 104857600

# ImageMaxWidth is the maximum width a returned image may be.  If you only want
# tiles served, rather than whole images, you could change this to 1024.
#
# Env: RAIS_IMAGEMAXWIDTH
# CLI: --image-max-width
ImageMaxWidth = 20480

# ImageMaxHeight is the maximum height a returned image may be.  If you only want
# tiles served, rather than whole images, you could change this to 1024.
#
# Env: RAIS_IMAGEMAXHEIGHT
# CLI: --image-max-height
