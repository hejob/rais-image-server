# Copy this to docker-compose.override.yml and modify as needed.  This file
# adds some dev-friendly container magic to the mix:
#
# - All binaries are mounted into the container so you can test out local changes
# - RAIS directly exposes its port to the host machine for quick debugging
#
# Note that docker-compose.override.yml is only automatically used if you
# *don't* specify a compose file.  e.g., `docker-compose up` will use
# docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.override.yml (if present).  But
# `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml` will *not* use the override file.  If
# you wanted to use this with, for instance, datadog, you'd have to merge the
# datadog config with the overrides or else set up something like this:
#
#     alias ddog='docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.datadog.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml'
